# Cruise-Control-System

The goal of this project is to design a embedded software using a model-based approach. Based on a set of requirements, we developed functional specification for a cruise control system. This functional specification will then be implemented using the synchronous programming language Esterel. The result will be an executable reactive program that fulfils the requirements for the cruise control system.
